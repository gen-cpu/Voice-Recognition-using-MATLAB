# 🎤 Voice Recognition using Pattern Recognition Techniques

## 📌 Project Description
This project focuses on **voice recognition** as an application of **pattern recognition**. The objective is to analyze and classify human voice signals by extracting distinguishing features and applying machine learning techniques.

The system learns unique voice patterns from audio recordings and uses them to recognize or classify speakers. This project was developed for **academic purposes** as part of a pattern recognition course.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset Type:** Voice recordings
- **Source:** Recorded voices of classmates
- **Content:** Short speech samples per speaker
- **Purpose:** Speaker recognition / classification
- **Ethics Note:**  
  All recordings were collected **with consent** and used strictly for **educational and non-commercial purposes**.

The dataset represents real-world challenges such as speaker variation, tone differences, and recording noise.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **MATLAB**
- **Signal Processing techniques**
- **Pattern Recognition algorithms**
- Feature extraction and classification methods

---

## 🧹 Preprocessing
Before feature extraction, the following preprocessing steps were applied:
- Noise reduction
- Silence removal
- Signal normalization
- Segmentation of voice samples

These steps help improve recognition accuracy by standardizing the audio input.

---

## 🔍 Feature Extraction
Relevant audio features were extracted from each voice signal, such as:
- Time-domain features
- Frequency-domain features
- Statistical features of the signal

These features form a numerical representation of each speaker’s voice.

---

## 🤖 Classification
- **Task:** Speaker recognition / classification
- **Approach:** Supervised pattern recognition
- **Input:** Extracted voice features
- **Output:** Predicted speaker identity

The classifier learns patterns that distinguish one speaker’s voice from another.

---

## 📈 Evaluation
Model performance was evaluated using:
- Classification accuracy
- Confusion matrix

These metrics measure how well the system recognizes different speakers.

---

## ✅ Key Outcomes
- Successfully implemented a voice-based pattern recognition system
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of feature extraction for voice signals
- Achieved reliable speaker classification results
- Gained hands-on experience with real audio data

---

## 🎯 Applications
- Speaker recognition systems
- Voice-based authentication
- Human-computer interaction
- Speech and audio analysis research

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **pattern recognition techniques** can be applied to voice signals for speaker recognition. By combining signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification, the system effectively learns and distinguishes individual voice patterns.
